# VisualGenderGap
This project includes a graph that visualizes the gender gap among college students from different majors from 1970 to 2010. This is a project offered and guided by Dataquest.io, an online learning platform. The focus of this project was to observe the gender gap in STEM fields and to practice how to apply basic plot aesthetics rules to a graph. The final graph includes 17 small graphes depicting the gender gap in each major and each small graph represents a major.

# The Data
The data used in this project was released by The Department of Education Statistics (https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2013menu_tables.asp) and compiled by data scientist Randal Olson. The data provides the percentage of women obtaining a bachlor degree from each major across a 40-year time span. Male percentage for each major was calculated by using 100 minus the percentage of women.

# Observation
Generally speaking, there is a gender gap in the majority of the STEM majors, including physical sciences, computer sciences, and engineering. The gender gap is more ambiguous for mathmatics and statistics, and surprisingly, is reserved for majors like biology and even more so for psychology. Interestingly, from another unrelated project, I also noticed that college students graduating with a psychology degree made relatively less comparing to other STEM majors. It is worth exploring if the percentage of women in a major relates to the average income for college graduates of the specific major. In addition, if there is data showing people's perception of masculinity of a given major over the years, it would be intriguing to explore whether such perception relates to the size of the gender gap. 

# Note
The observation above is drawn from eye-balling. To make a formal conclusion, statistics method like t-test should be implemented.
